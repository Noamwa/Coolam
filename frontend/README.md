# Coolam
this is a repository where we develop the first social network for the entire web


first actions: 

* Define MVP
  * a user can download the extesion
  * a user can enable and disable the extension
  * when the extension is enabled
    * when the user is logged in
      * when navigating to a site on the web the user can see all comments and likes made on each section of this website e.g. a photo, a story or a part of it.
      * the user can add likes and commets himself
      
    * when the user is not logged in
      * the user should be able to login / register (probably only via google, facebook etc.. we should aim not to be identity providers)
      * can the user see application data and maybe not interact with it ?
      
  * when the extension is disabled
    * when the user navigates through the web - the extension has no effect on the experience
